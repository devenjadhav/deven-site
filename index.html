      <p>
        when i was 14, and decided to teach myself to code. that changed the
        trajectory of my life, and i am working on bringing that experience to
        thousands of students across the world. i currently work as the events
        and production lead at
        <a href="https://hackclub.com">[hack club]</a>.
      </p>

      i am also a freshman at
      <a href="https://unc.edu">unc chapel hill</a> studying a combination of
      philosophy, computer science, and behavioural psychology. go heels!

      <p>
        apart from code, hackathons and coffee, i like playing the guitar,
        having deep conversations and ham radio (KQ4CHM). i am also learning to
        knit, and will hopefully have made a giant sweater soon. probably a pair
        of socks as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        my life revolves around a set of principles and beliefs that have come
        into existence over the last decade or so. all of those are documented
        in my <a href="/manifesto.html">[manifesto]</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        finally, if you're interested in tech, running hackathons, production,
        or just about anything, please feel free to reach out to me via email.
        My email is my first name at this domain. if you're based out of
        vermont, or the chapel hill area, i would love to meet you in person and
        buy you a coffee.
